#TicTacToe

This program is a command line based TicTacToe game where you play against the computer. The algorithms used were Min-Max and Alpha-Beta prunning, and it was devolped for my 'Inteligent Systems' class. As this was a project done while in college and at the same time of other projects, the code most certainly is not optimized.

###Algorithms Implemented

      * Min-Max
      * Alpha-Beta Prunning

###Bugs

      * No know bugs.
